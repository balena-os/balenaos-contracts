        When building images we need a recipe list for bitbake, and a package

        list for the package manager. This can both be defined by using different

        types, `sw.recipe.yocto` or `sw.package.yocto` and the sw.package type

        can be removed to simplify.

        * Class, the image type

        * Reboot-required, whether it requires a reboot to be activated
